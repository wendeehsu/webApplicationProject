# Client
This is the frontend side of the platform.

## First time setup
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). To check if you have it, open your terminal and type
```
node --version
```
if it shows the version number, then you're good to go!

2. Assuming you already `git pull` this project, please `cd` to this client directory. In your terminal, the current file path should be under `/client-bagel-buddy`

3. Install required libraries. In the terminal, type in
```
npm install
```

4. After installation finishes, we can now run the web :D

## Run the web

1. In the project directory (aka `/client-bagel-buddy`), run this in the terminal:

```
npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode. \
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You can start coding now! The page will reload when you make changes.

## Stop the web
1. type `Ctrl + C` in the terminal (`Command + C` for mac users)
